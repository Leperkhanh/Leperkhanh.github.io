Following a month of the challenging educational program that Flatiron gives, we are at our first project that utilizes the information from the curriculum, to compose a CLI program that assembles data from an API. The API figures out that information permitting the client to make demands on. This was my opportunity to flaunt all that I have found out about Ruby and make the first application that is all my own. 

 

To begin, there were exercises given and abundant recordings and data to help tackle this undertaking just as tips on all parts of the task which was change useful. They gave the data to make a skeleton application and respository on Github. What's more, They given questions to make you figure out, what will the application do? What is the user's experience? where will the information originate from? What will you have to do with that information once you have it? In what manner will you show that information one level profound to the client?  

  

Before I began at Flatiron, I was a nail technician for a long time. Due to Covid-19, I was furloughed from my activity and needed to begin thinking about an alternate profession way, which drove me to Flatiron! I needed to make something that mirrored my past and who I have been for such a long time. I thought, why not make an application on movies and get information for the movie. There was a superb API called The Movie Database. 

  

After using rest-client to get information and parse it, I was able to make a CLI that could display the top rated movies, most popular movies, trending movies, and you can also search for movies by name.  

  

 This venture put to test everything that has been educated to me in the course of recent weeks. It was difficult, however at long last it summurized everything I have learned, and left me with something to be glad for.

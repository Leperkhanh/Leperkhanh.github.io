I got my first computer when I was 10 years old from my Uncle Simon. He gave me one of his older computers but I was still facinated by it. I stayed on the computer all day and night, trying to figure out how to use it and find out new things I can do. As the years past, I kept trying to improve my computer, either through software or hardware. I learned to code once websites start coming out that makes it so you can personalize it. It was through html and css coding and I didn't even know I was doing it. Time passes by, and as I enter my 30's I decide to learn alittle bit more about coding. The past few months have been about learning web development and learning how to read and understand what I am seeing. I finally decided to go to school in order to learn more, and see how a professional environment would be. The journey has been great so far. Learning now things and not being confused by what I am looking at anymore makes it more fun. I will continue on this journey, hopefully getting this best that I can in this course and a career I would love to have.

I first learned about variables while in Algebra class. I never knew it would pop up again. Varibles make an object easy to select and use for a function. I use a varible to see the objects in a metaphor way.  Instead of a song I wanted being selected with a long object id, I can give it a variable of  "first_song" and can keep using that varible within that method. Variables have made my programming experience much easier.

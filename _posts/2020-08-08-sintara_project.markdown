The second project in the Flatiron curriculum was to create a web app that uses Sinatra and Active Records. For my project I really wanted to make something that I could actually use. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies so, I figured I would make an app that users could create reviews on movies they have watched. In order for other movie users to have an idea of what movie that would like to watch next.

 I called it Movie-Guru.This website is very basic with a few extra features such as features only an admin has permission to do. This is my first actual website! The excitement I get every time I see the site knowing that I built this is amazing. I know looking back in a few months that this project will seem simple and plain compared to my future projects but, as for now I am very satisfied. I canâ€™t wait to improve as a developer and keep on learning new skills to keep improving my apps.
